## React-JSPM

A really good project stub based on Jack Franklin's [JSPM/React talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpMnRifyGyw).

Really good stuff includes:

- Really cool 'No Task-Runner' workflow
- In the talk, Jack uses a MakeFile for the production build step, but I used npm scripts in package.json
- ES6 React syntax
